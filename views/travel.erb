	<strong><h3>Travel</h3></strong><br/>
	
	<strong><h4>Arrival and Departure</h4></strong>
	The closest airport is Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Arrival for all competitors will be on Thursday, September 30, 2010. Competitors should plan for a departure any time after 9pm Sunday October 3, 2010. 
	<br/><br/>
	<a href="http://www.shuttleexpress.com/" target="_blank">Shuttle Express</a> provides airport transportation as well. SYC has organized a group rate for those wanting to take Shuttle Express from SYC to SeaTac following the awards presentation on Sunday evening. 
	
	<br/><strong><h4>Transportation</h4></strong>
	It is possible to get to and from the airport with Seattle's new light rail for $4.50. From the airport follow the signs for the <a href="http://www.soundtransit.org/Riding-Sound-Transit/Schedules-and-Facilities/Central-Link-Light-Rail.xml" target="_blank">Link light rail</a> at the east end of SeaTac Airport. Take the train all the way to the end of the line at Westlake Center. This will cost $2.50. Take another street car that leaves from Westlake Center, called the <a href="http://www.seattlestreetcar.org/" target="_blank">South Lake Union Line</a>, to the Lake Union Park. This ride costs $2, and you will find yourself standing in front of the Center for Wooden Boats (regatta venue). The Courtyard Marriott (see <a href="/hotels">hotels</a>) is about 300 yards to the Northwest if you walk through the park and over the footbridge.<br/> 
	
	<br/><strong><h4>The Venues</h4></strong>
	The Championship is hosted by Seattle Yacht Club (SYC), but will be raced out of the Center for Wooden Boats (CWB), located on the south end of Seattleâ€™s Lake Union. Competitors will register and race at the CWB. The awards dinner will be at SYC.<br/><br/>
